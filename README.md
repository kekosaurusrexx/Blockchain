# Python Blockchain with smart contracts
This is a simple proof of concept of a blockchain written in python.
It aims to correctly implement a blockchain with mining, transactions, smart contracts and networking.
Written for a university project.

## ToDos
- implement transactions
- implement smart contracts
- implement automatic difficulty adjustment
- implement mining rewards
- implement networking capabilitys
- implement multiprocessing
- implement multiprocessing-mining
- add a requirements file

## What it can do
- load & save chain as block-files locally
- proof of work with hashes and difficulty
- create correctly chained blocks
- validate the blockchain
