# Python Blockchain with smart contracts
This is a simple proof of concept of a blockchain written in python. \n
It aims to correctly implement a blockchain with mining, transactions, smart contracts and networking. \n
Written for a university project. \n

## ToDos
- Load chain from block-files
- implement transactions
- implement smart contracts
- implement automatic difficulty adjustment
- implement mining rewards
- implement networking capabilitys
- implement blockchain validation

## What it can do
- Store chain as block-files locally
- proof of work with hashes and difficulty
- create correctly chained blocks
